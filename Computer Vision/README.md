Computer vision is a field within artificial intelligence focused on interpreting and understanding visual information.

**Image Analysis**</br>
Recognize products in shelves : Identify particular objects within a single image for applications like pinpointing products on shelves, locating merchandise in a store display, or identifying items on an assembly line.

Custom model : Image classification and Object detection

Search photos with image retrieval : Search your photo album for specific moments, like last summer's wedding or your pet, based on image content instead of just tags or keywords. This method enables easy retrieval of cherished memories by what's depicted in the photos.

Add dense captions to the image: Generate human-readable captions for all important objects detected in your image.

Remove background from the images : Easily remove the background and preserve foreground elements in your image.

Add captions to the image : Generate a human-readable sentence that describes the content of an image.

Detect common objedcts in the image : Identify and extract bounding boxes for thousands of recognizable objects and living beings within images.

Extract tags from the images : Extract tags from images based on thousands of recognizable objects, living beings, scenery, and actions.

Detective sensitive content images :  Utilize content moderation to detect sensitive content in images, such as Adult content (explicit nudity and sexual acts), Racy content (sexually suggestive material), and Gory content (images containing blood or gore), enabling effective moderation in your applications.

Smart cropped iamges : Automatically crop your images to emphasize the images' most important areas.

**Faces**</br>
Detect faces in an image : Identify the location of one or more human faces in images, including attributes like pose, presence of face masks, and facial landmarks.

**OCR**</br>
Extract text from images : Leverage the Read API to extract printed and handwritten text in supported languages from images, PDFs, and TIFF files. This optical character recognition (OCR) capability supports mixed languages within documents and images, eliminating the need for language specification.

**Spatial Analysis**</br>
Vedio retrieval summary : Video search and summarization employs a blend of natural language processing and computer vision methods to analyze video content efficiently. This approach enables swift and concise summarization of key points within a video, while also facilitating targeted search for specific moments, streamlining the process of locating relevant content.

Count people in an area : Analyze real-time or recorded video to count the number of people in a designated zone in a camera's field of view.

Detect whne people cross a line : Analyze real-time or recorded video to detect when a person crosses a line in the camera's field of view.

Detect when people enter or exit zone : Analyze real-time or recorded video to detect when a person enters or exits a zone in the camera's field of view.

Monitor social distancing : Analyze real-time or recorded video to detect when people violate a distance rule in the camera's field of view.
