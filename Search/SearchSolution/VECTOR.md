Vector support includes indexing, storing, and querying of vector embeddings from a search index.
On the indexing side, Azure AI Search takes vector embeddings and uses a nearest neighbors algorithm to place similar vectors close together in an index. Internally, it creates vector indexes for each vector field.

Vector search is like a supercharged search engine that can understand and find things based on similarities, not just keywords. It's really helpful for finding things that are similar to each other or for suggesting things you might like based on what you've searched for before.

Vector search Scenarios:

**Encode Text with OpenAI or Open Source Models**: Use powerful models to convert text into mathematical vectors. These vectors represent the meaning of the text.

**Perform Similarity Search Across Different Data Types**: Search for similar items across various types of data, like images, text, video, or audio. This is called multi-modal search.

**Handle Multilingual Documents**: Use a single model to encode documents in different languages, making it possible to search for documents regardless of language.

**Combine Vector and Text Search**: Merge search results from both vector-based and text-based searches to provide comprehensive responses.

**Apply Filters to Reduce Processing**: Use filters on text and numeric fields to narrow down the data processed by vector search, making searches more efficient.

**Create Vector Database for Knowledge Base**: Build a database using vectors to store information, which can be used as an external knowledge base or long-term memory for our system.)

**Limitations**:

- You'll need to provide the embeddings using Azure OpenAI or a similar open source solution, as Azure AI Search doesn't generate these for your content.
- Customer Managed Keys (CMK) aren't supported.
- There are storage limitations applicable so you should check what our service quota provides.



To integrate vector search into Azure AI Search, we encode our search query using an embedded model. This model converts the query into mathematical vectors representing its meaning. Then, these vectors are used to perform a search over the vector fields in your search engine, allowing for more nuanced and accurate search results.

To determine if our search has vector fields, we can execute an empty search query. The result will include a vector field containing a number array. Additionally, we can inspect the schema of our index and look for a field named 'vectorSearch' with the type 'Collection(Edm.single)'. This field should have an algorithm configuration and an attribute named 'dimension'.

We can only query a vector field with a query vector.

An embedding is a data representation utilized by machine learning models to capture the semantic meaning of text. It's like an array of numbers, where the numerical distance between two embeddings reflects their semantic similarity. For instance, if two texts share similarities, their representations in the embedding space should also be similar.

Different models are designed to excel at specific tasks. 
- For capturing semantic similarity between text pieces, Similarity search embeddings are ideal. 
- For assessing the relevance of a long document to a short query, Text search embeddings are preferred.
- Searching through code snippets and natural language queries, Code search embeddings are useful.

Users input queries into an embedding model, such as the text-embedding-ada-002 model, which converts text into vectors to generate text embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text for various applications.

The embedding space serves as the foundation for vector queries and consists of all the vector fields generated by the same embedding model. Within this space, similar items are positioned close together, while dissimilar items are positioned farther apart. This arrangement allows for efficient similarity searches, as items with similar meanings are grouped together for easier retrieval.

In a vector field search, the "vector" represents the numerical embedding of a piece of text. Each value in the "value" array corresponds to a dimension in the embedding space. This numerical representation captures the semantic meaning of the text, where similar texts have embeddings closer in this multi-dimensional space.
